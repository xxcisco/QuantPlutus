# MCP Setup — connect Cursor / Claude Code / Codex to QuantDinger

This is the detailed setup guide for wiring an MCP-capable AI client (Cursor,
Claude Code, Codex desktop, OpenClaw, NanoBot, …) to a QuantDinger backend.
The root [`README`](../../README.md) gives the 30-second pitch; everything
below is the actual recipe.

The QuantDinger backend exposes an **Agent Gateway** at `/api/agent/v1`, and a
small MCP server (published on PyPI as
[`quantdinger-mcp`](https://pypi.org/project/quantdinger-mcp/)) wraps that
gateway as Model Context Protocol tools. After one human-issued token, your AI
client can read markets, manage strategies, run backtests, and (paper-only by
default) place trades — without ever seeing your exchange keys or your admin
JWT.

> **Two non-negotiable safety properties.** Every agent call is
> **audit-logged**, and trading-class tokens are **paper-only by default**.
> Live execution requires *both* `paper_only=false` on the token AND
> `AGENT_LIVE_TRADING_ENABLED=true` on the server.

---

## Step 1 — Pick a backend, then issue an agent token

The MCP client config in Step 2 is **identical** for both backends — only the
value of `QUANTDINGER_BASE_URL` changes.

### Path A · Hosted ([ai.quantdinger.com](https://ai.quantdinger.com)) — 30 seconds

Best for: trying QuantDinger from Cursor / Claude Code without installing
anything; demos; research notebooks against shared datasets.

1. Sign up at [ai.quantdinger.com](https://ai.quantdinger.com).
2. Open **Sidebar → Agent Tokens** → **Issue Token**.
3. `QUANTDINGER_BASE_URL=https://ai.quantdinger.com`.

The hosted instance is locked to `paper_only=true` and the **T** (Trading)
scope is rejected at issuance — agents can read markets, manage strategies in
your tenant, and run backtests, but never route real-money orders.

### Path B · Self-hosted (this repo) — production, private data, live trading

Best for: anyone with their own exchange keys, anyone with private
strategies/data, teams behind a VPN, or anyone who eventually wants live
execution.

1. Bring up the stack per the [root README's "Try in 2 minutes"](../../README.md#try-in-2-minutes).
2. Log in as admin, open **Sidebar → Agent Tokens** (or `http://localhost:8888/#/agent-tokens`).
3. `QUANTDINGER_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8888` (or your LAN URL).

You decide scopes (incl. **T**), market/instrument allowlists, rate limits,
and whether `AGENT_LIVE_TRADING_ENABLED=true` is ever flipped.

### Issue the token (either path)

1. Click **Issue Token** → name it (`cursor-mcp`, `claude-research`, …).
2. Pick scopes — start with **R + B** (read + backtest); add **W** to let the
   agent create/edit strategies.
3. Copy the token **once** — the dialog shows the full string once; the
   server only keeps a SHA-256 hash.

Prefer the CLI? See [`AGENT_QUICKSTART.md`](AGENT_QUICKSTART.md) for the
equivalent `curl`.

## Step 2 — Wire the MCP server into your AI client

The MCP server lives in [`mcp_server/`](../../mcp_server/). Two transports work
everywhere:

### A. Local stdio (Cursor, Claude Code, Codex desktop, etc.)

The server is published on PyPI as
[`quantdinger-mcp`](https://pypi.org/project/quantdinger-mcp/). Drop this into
`.cursor/mcp.json`, `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`, or your
client's equivalent (template: [`cursor-mcp.example.json`](cursor-mcp.example.json)):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "quantdinger": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["quantdinger-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "QUANTDINGER_BASE_URL":    "http://localhost:8888",
        "QUANTDINGER_AGENT_TOKEN": "qd_agent_xxxxxxxx"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`uvx` ([install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/))
downloads + caches the package on first run; no virtualenv setup. If you
prefer pip:

```bash
pip install quantdinger-mcp
# then use {"command": "quantdinger-mcp", "args": []}
```

For Claude Code's CLI helper:

```bash
claude mcp add quantdinger \
  --env QUANTDINGER_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8888 \
  --env QUANTDINGER_AGENT_TOKEN=qd_agent_xxxxxxxx \
  -- uvx quantdinger-mcp
```

### B. Remote HTTP (cloud agents, browser IDEs, anything that can't spawn subprocesses)

Run the MCP server as a long-lived service, then point clients at the URL:

```bash
QUANTDINGER_BASE_URL=https://your-host \
QUANTDINGER_AGENT_TOKEN=qd_agent_xxxxxxxx \
QUANTDINGER_MCP_TRANSPORT=streamable-http \
QUANTDINGER_MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
QUANTDINGER_MCP_PORT=7800 \
quantdinger-mcp
# clients connect to http://your-host:7800
```

Use `QUANTDINGER_MCP_TRANSPORT=sse` instead for clients that only speak the
older SSE transport. Put a reverse proxy in front for TLS and IP allowlisting.

---

## Step 3 — Talk to your agent

Restart the IDE, then ask things like:

- *"Pull the last 90 daily candles for BTC/USDT and tell me what the regime
  detector says."*
- *"Backtest the 20/60 SMA crossover on ETH/USDT 4h between 2024-01-01 and
  2024-06-30 and stream the result as it runs."*
- *"Create a strategy named **eth-trend-bot**, use the indicator I just
  designed, leave it in `stopped` state."*

Long-running jobs (`/api/agent/v1/jobs/{id}/stream`) are exposed as SSE so the
agent can react to partial results without polling. Every call shows up under
**Agent Tokens → Audit log** with route, scope class, status code, and
duration.

## Using QuantDinger as a *coding* agent context

If you're editing this repo with Cursor / Claude Code / Codex, the repo also
ships a Cursor Skill at
[`.cursor/skills/quantdinger-agent-workflow/SKILL.md`](../../.cursor/skills/quantdinger-agent-workflow/SKILL.md)
that explains the Agent Gateway internals, red lines (no real keys, paper-only
by default), and where to verify changes. Read
[`AGENT_ENVIRONMENT_DESIGN.md`](AGENT_ENVIRONMENT_DESIGN.md) for the full
layered-contracts model.
