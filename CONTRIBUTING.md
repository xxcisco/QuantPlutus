## ⚠️ Please Read First

QuantDinger is **not a DAO**.
There is **no token**, **no airdrop**, and **no financial incentive** at this stage.

If you are looking for short-term rewards, promotions, or token speculation,
this project is probably **not a good fit**.

If you are interested in:
- building credible infrastructure
- publishing real work under your name
- shaping an early-stage system with long-term value

you are very welcome here.

## 🧑‍💻 Ways to Contribute

### 1) Core Engineering
- Python strategy engine
- execution logic
- AI / LLM agent workflows
- backtesting and data pipelines

Small, focused improvements are preferred.

---

### 2) Strategy & Research
- example strategies
- research notebooks
- execution experiments
- performance analysis

This is a good place to demonstrate how you think.

---

### 3) Documentation & Explanation
- tutorials and setup guides
- architecture explanations
- design rationale

Clear explanations matter as much as good code.

---

### 4) Content & Advocacy
- technical blog posts
- demo videos
- system breakdowns
- honest reviews or critiques

You are not “marketing”.
You are explaining something real.

## 🛠️ Development Setup

This repository contains:

- `backend_api_python/`: Flask backend + strategy runtime
- `docker-compose.yml` / `docker-compose.ghcr.yml`: deployment stacks

The web UI source lives in the separate private **QuantDinger-Vue** repo, which publishes `ghcr.io/brokermr810/quantdinger-frontend` to GHCR on every `v*` tag — both Compose files pull that image directly.

### Backend (Python)

```bash
cd backend_api_python
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp env.example .env   # Windows: copy env.example .env
python run.py
```

### Frontend

The SPA lives in the private **QuantDinger-Vue** repo. Tagging a release there (`git tag vX.Y.Z && git push --tags`) triggers `.github/workflows/release-frontend.yml`, which builds a multi-arch image and pushes it to `ghcr.io/brokermr810/quantdinger-frontend`. No frontend artefacts are committed here — pin the consumed tag via `IMAGE_TAG` (or `FRONTEND_TAG` for a per-side override) in a root-level `.env`.

For local iteration without publishing, clone the Vue repo into `./QuantDinger-Vue/` (gitignored) and run `docker compose up --build` — see **DEVELOPMENT.md → Building frontend from local source**.

## 🌿 Branching & Pull Requests

### Branch naming

- `fix/xxx` — bug fixes
- `feat/xxx` — new features
- `docs/xxx` — documentation
- `chore/xxx` — maintenance

### Pull request guidelines

Please include:

- what changed and why
- how to test
- screenshots/GIFs for UI changes (if applicable)
- backward compatibility notes (if any)

Keep PRs focused and reviewable.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Verification

We do not enforce a single test command yet. Please at least:

- **Backend**: run the API locally and verify affected endpoints
- **Frontend**: run the dev server and verify affected pages/components

Bug fixes should include a minimal regression test when practical.

---

## 🔐 Security

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

For security reports, contact the maintainer via the email in README.md and include:

- description of the issue
- steps to reproduce
- impact assessment
